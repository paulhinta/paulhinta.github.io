[U of T Hacks IX](https://uofthacks-ix.devpost.com/?ref_content=default&ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=portfolio)

## Ideas:
1. Computer vision with filter

Simple MVP:
1. Input image
2. Cut face and cutout static background (dress like your grandpa) 
3. Soldier -> Face cutout, what you would look like
4. Output image as filter in camera

Library for camera enabling on website: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jslib-html5-camera-photo

Run the program locally:

1. Clone repository
2. Activate the virtual environment inside the root directory.
Windows:
```
./venv\Scripts\activate
```
Mac/Linux:
```
source venv/Scripts/activate
```
3. Cd into the _gwyneth_ directory:
```
cd gwyneth
```
4. Run the Django application:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
